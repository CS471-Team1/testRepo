## Team Name: Team 1

## Project Name: GitBot

## Project Description:
Git hub bot based on the probot framework whose main function is auto tagging untagged issues submitted to a repo. This bot will parse the text of an untagged issue and attempt to determine if it is either a bug report or a feature request and then assign a tag accordingly. Once the bot has auto-tagged an issue it will assign it to a designated collaborator in the project who can then chose who to delegate that issue out to.
